# News-Summarization
Bi-Directional Stacked LSTM news text summarization with encoder-decoder and attention mechanism plus Bleu score.
The model works well for news based text summarization but biased towards news publications from a particular corpus. To develop a more generalized model, you can run the model on a different data set with the model weights. You will need to perform some text formatting because the news corpus used has a maximum input length of 70, so you will need to make some adjustments to use a different dataset for generalization.
